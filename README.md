---

## ‚ú® Features

The application successfully fulfills the following specified requirements:

1.  **Main Heading:** The application clearly displays the main title, **‚ÄúAssignment-2 Counter Application.‚Äù**
2.  **Dual Component Implementation:** The counter logic is implemented using two distinct components:
    * A **Class Component**
    * B **Functional Component**
3.  **Shared Functionality:** Both components include **Increment (`+`)** and **Decrement (`-`)** buttons.
4.  **Non-Negative Constraint:** The counter value is strictly enforced to be **not less than 0**. The decrement functionality is conditionally disabled or prevented when the counter is at zero.
5.  **Layout:** Both the Class Component and the Functional Component are displayed **side-by-side** (in a **ROW**) on the screen.
6.  **Attractive UI:** The user interface is designed to be clean, intuitive, and visually appealing.
7.  **Proper Headings:** Each counter is clearly titled with its type: **"Class Component"** and **"Functional Component"**.
